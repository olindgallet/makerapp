				This vintage microscope is modernized with computer-controlled stage, focus and imaging sensor to collect hundreds of photographs in a grid pattern. Photographs are taken at 20 focal planes for each field of view and the best-focused frames and these are assembled into a single mosaic. In addition, the 20 photographs are stored as a z-stack set for playback by the end-user.

				The end user is a teacher or student learning microscopic identification skills as a medical professional. The learning interface  is a web-based virtual microscope allowing views of the mosaic images at various magnifications. The mosaic is mapped to the z-stacks to allow the user to explore the focal planes as you would with an actual microscope.

			X Over Zero is the studio of designers Katherine Voorhies and Duane McLemore. The studio was founded on the premise that contemporary computation and fabrication can be used to push the edges of the possible, even by fiercely independent practitioners working on a shoestring budget.  

			Our designs are born from Duane's wild-eyed mathematical experimentations, and are not complete until Katherine's eye for polish and refinement is applied through digital sculpting.

			We harnesses advanced computational design and professional 3d printing to craft objects that test the limits of current technology and are at the forefront of a new aesthetic that wouldn't otherwise be possible.  

			Our guiding principle is: if it can be made by traditional production methods, we don't design it for 3d printing. It is this principle that sets us apart from other designers and brands.

			The jewelry we design is not just flattering, it also starts conversations. The forms are delicate and intricate, but they also have an ordering logic that will keep you contemplating their beguiling complexities.
